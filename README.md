There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

We hear about celebrity breakups almost everyday. I'm curious about if celebrities have a higher divorce rate than the general population? If so, what is their divorce rate? How long are their marriage last? What's the key reason to drive their divorces? Is it predictable?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

-  **Data**:  To do so, I parsed data of Hollywood's actor and actress from the following two wikipedia websites.

   * [American male film actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:American_male_film_actors)
